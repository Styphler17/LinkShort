# AdSense Subdomain Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Problem: Can't Add Subdomain to AdSense

You've requested Google to crawl your subdomain `linkshort.brastyphler.click`, but you're having trouble adding it to AdSense. Here's how to fix this:

## üîç Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Verify Google Has Crawled Your Subdomain

**Check if Google has indexed your subdomain:**

1. **Google Search Console**
   - Go to [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
   - Add your subdomain: `https://linkshort.brastyphler.click`
   - Verify ownership (usually automatic if same hosting)
   - Check "Coverage" report to see if pages are indexed

2. **Direct Google Search**
   - Search: `site:linkshort.brastyphler.click`
   - If results appear, Google has crawled it
   - If no results, wait longer or request indexing

### Step 2: Ensure Subdomain is Live and Accessible

**Check these requirements:**

1. **HTTPS Enabled**
   - Your subdomain must have SSL certificate
   - Should redirect from HTTP to HTTPS automatically

2. **No Robots.txt Blocking**
   - Check `https://linkshort.brastyphler.click/robots.txt`
   - Should not block Googlebot

3. **No Meta Robots Blocking**
   - Check your HTML for `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`
   - Should allow indexing

4. **Site is Functional**
   - Subdomain should load properly
   - No 404 or server errors

### Step 3: Apply for AdSense with Subdomain

1. **Go to [adsense.google.com](https://adsense.google.com)**
