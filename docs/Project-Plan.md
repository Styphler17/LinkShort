# LinkShort - Project Plan

**Objective**
Create a simple, fast web tool to shorten long URLs into compact, shareable links.

## Core Functionality

* Input field for a long URL.
* "Shorten" button to generate a short link.
* Output display of the shortened link with a copy button.
* Optional: track shortened URLs in localStorage.

## UI Structure

* Clean centered form:

  * App title: "LinkShort"
  * Input field: accepts valid URLs
  * Button: "Shorten"
* Output:

  * Display short URL
  * Copy icon/button

### Example Flow

1. User lands on the page.
2. Enters a long URL.
3. Clicks the Shorten button.
4. App generates a short link (mocked or backed by service).
5. User copies and uses the new short URL.

### Extras (Optional)

* Local storage of history of shortened links.
* QR code generation.
* Analytics panel for click stats (future).
* API-based shortening (e.g. TinyURL, Bitly).

Once Vite is set up, we can scaffold this project using HTML + Alpine.js + Tailwind just like QuickNote. Let me know when you're ready to proceed with step-by-step implementation.
